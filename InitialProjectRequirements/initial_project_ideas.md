# Project Ideas

In this file (but not restricted to), you can get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentors and to keep the history of!

### 1. Flight Tracking app
App that tracks flight based on flight number, or airline. It can be real time or past flight. Might also add info about airports, or search by airplane registration number.
What is interesting about apps like this is that the data is dynamic and changes all the time. The app might also include setInterval for updating the flight status page.
External APIs: https://aviationstack.com/documentation

### 2. IT documentation app/Ticketing system
An app that users can add documentation about the IT infrastructure in place. Create different configurations - servers, workstations, network equipment, printers, etc. Each of those will have detailed info - name, location, assigned user, etc.
Also, a place to enter details about Internet, LAN, Wi-Fi, contacts, vendors, etc.
Another part of the app can be a ticketing system - creating tickets for issues or requests. The ticketing side can have access to the entries from the documentation side - like contacts, configurations, users, etc. Will keep track of work done for each case, possibly keeping track of time spent on each.
I use an app like this all the time, and it is way over complicated for what I use it, so I can only include things that I care about. It will need some authentication.
External APIs: Not sure if an external API will be used for the documentation, but the ticketing system can use an API to send out emails for successfully submitting a ticket, or work/reply on a ticket. One free API for sending emails is https://www.mailjet.com/pricing/

### 3. Sports live scores/league standings
App that will display live score, past scores, league standings, so forth.
The app would have a homepage with a list of matches that are live right now /if the API allows that for free/. It can also have a navigation sidebar with different leagues that will only show matches from that league or standings. Another option could be to favorite leagues or teams.
Similar app can be viewed at https://www.livescore.com/en/

## Preferred
I would prefer the second option. It is quite a big project - we can split it in two - create either the ticketing side or the documentation side, and add the second part for a later project.
